# BowBoy-School-Project
This is a 2D platformer game made with a team of 5 people for our final semester project at College de Rosemont. The game consists of a 2D character moving in a level designed by one of our developpers. The character is equipped with a bow and arrow and his goal is to eliminate all enemies, which are the orangle slimes.
The folder size of the project exceeds the maximum of 25 MB so I put the folder in a google drive folder. The link for the folder is down below.
